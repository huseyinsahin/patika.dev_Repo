If the password is wrong, ask the user whether he can reset his password, if the user wants to reset it, check that the new password must not be the same as the password he entered incorrectly and forgot, and if the passwords are the same, the screen "Could not create password, please enter another password." If there is no problem, write the program that says "Password created".
