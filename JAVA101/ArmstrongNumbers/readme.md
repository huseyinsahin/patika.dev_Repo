# Armstrong Number

We write a program that finds whether a number is an armstrong number with Java loops.

## What is Armstrong Number?

- An n-digit number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the nth powers of the digits is equal to the number itself.

- Take, for example, the number 407. (4^3)+ (0^3)+(7^3) = 64+0+343 = 407 it gives the result. Which means that the number 407 is an armstrong number.

- Let's also look at the number 1342.(1^4)+(3^4)+(4^4)+(2^4) =1+81+256+16=354 armstrong is not a number because its number is not equal to 1342.
