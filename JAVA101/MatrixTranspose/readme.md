# Matrix Transpose

Write a program in Java that finds the transpose of a matrix constructed with multidimensional arrays.

To transpose the matrix means to swap the same numbered rows and columns of the matrix. The matrix obtained as a result of this operation is the transpose of the original matrix.

At this stage, the transpose (transpose) of a kxn matrix becomes an nxk matrix.
For example, suppose we have a matrix A.

The transpose of this matrix A is denoted by A^T (A to T).
