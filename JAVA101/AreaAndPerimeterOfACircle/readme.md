# Area and Perimeter of the Circle
Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of the circle whose radius you get from the user in Java.

- Area formula : π * r * r;
- Perimeter formula : 2 * π * r;

Write the program that finds the area of the circle slice whose radius r is the measure of the center angle 𝛼.

- Take 𝜋 = 3.14.
- Formula : (𝜋 * (r*r) * 𝛼) / 360
