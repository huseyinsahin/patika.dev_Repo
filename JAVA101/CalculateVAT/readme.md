# VAT Amount Calculator 
- Write a program that calculates the VAT value and the VAT amount of the money value received from the user with Java and prints it on the screen.

- (Note: Take the VAT amount as 18%)

- VAT-Free Amount = 10;

- Amount with VAT = 11.8;

- VAT Amount = 1.8;

**NOT:** If the amount entered is between 0 and 1000 TL, the VAT rate is 18%, if the amount is greater than 1000 TL, write the program that calculates the VAT amount as 8%.
