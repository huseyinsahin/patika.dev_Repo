# Suggesting Events Based on Air Temperature
**Conditions**
- Suggest to "Ski" if the temperature is less than 5.
- Suggest the "Cinema" event if the temperature is between 5 and 15.
- Suggest the "Picnic" event if the temperature is between 15 and 25.
- Suggest the "Swimming" event if the temperature is greater than 25.

If the conditions could have been created in any other way through the same example, find different solutions.
