# Leap Year Calculation

Write a program in Java to find whether the year the user entered is a leap year or not.

### What is a leap year?

A leap year is a year that has 366 days instead of 365 in the Gregorian calendar. Simply put, a leap year is a year with an extra day—February 29—which is added nearly every four years to the calendar year.

### How is a leap year calculated?

As a general rule, leap years are years that are a multiple of 4:
- Like 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024.

Of the years that are multiple of 100, only those that can be divided into 400 without remainder are leap years:
- For example, the years 1200, 1600, 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years.

The reason why only those exactly divisible by 400 are considered leap years is to correct the error that an astronomical year is approximately 365.242 days, not 365.25 days.
