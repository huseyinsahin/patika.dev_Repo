# Hypotenuse and Area Calculator
- Write a program in Java that takes the length of the perpendicular sides from the user and calculates the hypotenuse.

- Write a program that calculates the area of the triangle whose three side lengths you get from the user.

- Perimeter = 2𝑢

- 𝑢 = (a+b+c) / 2

- Area * Area = 𝑢 * (𝑢 − 𝑎)* (𝑢 − 𝑏) * (𝑢 − 𝑐)
