# GCF and LCM

We are writing a program that finds the GCF and LCM values of two numbers in Java.

**GCF:** The greatest common divisor of two or more natural numbers is called the greatest common divisor of these numbers, in short GCF.

**EXAMPLE:** Let's find the greatest common divisor of the numbers 18 and 24 step by step.

Divisors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

Divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

The largest of these common divisors, the number 6, is GCF.

**LCM:** The smallest of the common multiples of two or more natural numbers is called the least common multiple of these numbers, in short LCM.

**EXAMPLE:** Let's find the least common multiple of 6 and 8 step by step.

Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, …

Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, …

The smallest of these common multiples, the number 24, is LCM.
