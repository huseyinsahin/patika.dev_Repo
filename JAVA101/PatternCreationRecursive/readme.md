# Creating Methods by Pattern

In Java language, write a "Recursive" method without looping which obeys the following rule based on the n value received from the user.

**Rule :** Subtract 5 from the entered number up to where the entered number is 0 or negative. Print the last value to the screen during each subtraction. After the number is negative or 0, add 5 again. Again, print the last value of the number on the screen in each addition operation.

```
